# `render_as_tree`

## What is it

It's a library that allows you to visualize tree data structures in Rust with
output like `tree(1)`.

This crate was extracted from [ruut][ruut], a CLI intended for doing the same
thing. See that repo if you're interested in executing a tree visualizer from
the commandline or for something that can process common serialized data types
(e.g. JSON).
